Write a program that calculates and prints the sum of all the natural numbers divisible by either 3 or 5, up to a given limit entered by the user.

### [2. Greatest common divisor](https://github.com/vladIev/the_modern_cpp_challange/tree/main/src/math_problems/2_gcd)
Write a program that, given two positive integers, will calculate and print the greatest common divisor of the two.

### [3. Least common multiple](https://github.com/vladIev/the_modern_cpp_challange/tree/main/src/math_problems/3_lcm)
Write a program that will, given two or more positive integers, calculate and print the least common multiple of them all.

###  [4. Largest prime smaller than given number](https://github.com/vladIev/the_modern_cpp_challange/tree/main/src/math_problems/4_largest_prime_smaller_than_number)
Write a program that computes and prints the largest prime number that is smaller than a number provided by the user, which must be a positive integer.

### [5. Sexy prime pairs](https://github.com/vladIev/the_modern_cpp_challange/tree/main/src/math_problems/5_sexy_primes)
Write a program that prints all the sexy prime pairs up to a limit entered by the user.

### [6. Abundant numbers](https://github.com/vladIev/the_modern_cpp_challange/tree/main/src/math_problems/6_abundant_numbers)
Write a program that prints all abundant numbers and their abundance, up to a number entered by the user.

### [7. Amicable numbers](https://github.com/vladIev/the_modern_cpp_challange/tree/main/src/math_problems/7_amicable_numbers)
Write a program that prints the list of all pairs of amicable numbers smaller than 1,000,000.

### [8. Armstrong numbers](https://github.com/vladIev/the_modern_cpp_challange/tree/main/src/math_problems/8_armstrong_numbers)
Write a program that prints all Armstrong numbers with three digits.

Write a program that displays the normal binary representations, Gray code representations, and decoded Gray code values for all 5-bit numbers.

### [11. Numerical value to Roman](https://github.com/vladIev/the_modern_cpp_challange/tree/main/src/math_problems/11_numbers_to_roman)
Write a program that converts given numerical value to Roman representation.

### [12. Collatz sequence](https://github.com/vladIev/the_modern_cpp_challange/tree/main/src/math_problems/12_collatz_sequence)
Write a program that determines which number up to 1 million produces the longest Collatz sequence and what it's length is.
